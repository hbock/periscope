Periscope
---------

The Periscope project was originally started and written by Brandon Edens, of OSHEAN, Inc.
It was further developed by Harry Bock and Tyler Whittaker, also of OSHEAN, until early
2009, when the decision was made to transition away from monitoring directly in Periscope
to monitoring with the mature and widely-used Argus server.
